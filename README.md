## Problem Statement

Accessing quality mental health support is challenging for many. Social stigma, cost, and a lack of safe, judgment-free environments are significant barriers. Existing solutions often lack peer-driven, real-time, and anonymous support for users seeking help or wishing to support others.

## Solution

PeerHealApp addresses these challenges by providing:
- A safe and inclusive community where users can connect anonymously or openly with peers.
- Real-time chat, AI-based assistant, and curated resources.
- A transparent, reward-based model leveraging blockchain for trust and incentives.

## Application Architecture

The app follows a modular architecture for maintainability and scalability:

- `src/App.tsx`: Main routing and layout logic. Integrates authentication, navigation, protected routes, and persistent UI components (header, footer, emergency chatbot).
- `src/pages/`: Each route/page (e.g., HomePage, DashboardPage, AIAssistantPage, etc.).
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., Header, Footer, EmergencyChatbot, ProtectedRoute).
- `src/contexts/`: Context providers (e.g., AuthContext) for global state.
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions and custom hooks.
- `src/types/`: TypeScript types and interfaces.

**Routing Example:**
- `/` - Home
- `/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` - Auth
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard (protected)
- `/categories`, `/helpers`, `/ai-support`, etc. - Main features
- `/blockchain` - Algorand integration demo
